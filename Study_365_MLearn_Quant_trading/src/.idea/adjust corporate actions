AJUST FOR CORPORATE ACTIONS NOTES - https://studyfolk.com/play/145454

corporate actions (eg, splits and dividends) affect the stock price but are NOT reflected in the price data
so the price data MUST be adjusted to incorporate these in our quant trading data base

stock splits: company divids its existing shares into multiple shares
               eg multiplies current number of shares shares, sum total value of shares doesnt change

2 for -1 split doubles num,ber of shares, and each share price halves

why stock split?

1 . if price of each share is too high for investors to buy in bulk (generally shares traded in buckets / lots of 100 shares)
this lowers the entry bar for investors
2. increase the liquidity of the stock (how easy it is to buy or sell or the stock)
    larger numbner of shares available then higher liquidity

Why we need to adjust for stock splits?

there will be a large shock jump in the stock price at the stock split even though the investm,ent value is the same
it will appear that there is a drop of 50% fopr a 2-for-1 split. ie no market effect on the value, just corp action
dont want these anomalies to affect our model

we must adjust the previous historical data before the split, and divide it by the stock-split ratio
so the adjusted closing price will reflect the stocks true performance


how to adjust?

stock split annoucement data is available online, usually in following format


company - old face value - new facevalue (FV) - split date


use ration of old FV : new FV to get the multiplier

what is face value? - the price of the stock as reflected on the share contract (the share you buy)
                        THIS does NOT reflect the fair / market value at the time of the split
                        it uses the IPO value of the share when it was first offered as the referrence
                        the multiplier will still be the same though
